Honestly, I think conservatives have the toughest choice to make. Do we completely throw our values down the drain in a last ditch effort to, at best, have a small chance to save the Supreme Court? Do we protest vote for the Republican we *would've* supported, so that the GOP gets a clear message of who we want? Do we compromise and vote for Johnson, in the hopes that he gets Libertarianism (a philosophy quite similar to ours) mainstream? Do we cross the lines and vote for Clinton in the hopes that it destroys the alt right for good, and we come back with a vengeance in 2020?\n\nI honestly don't know yet. I want to support Johnson. I really do. But doing so is becoming more and more of a compromise every day. The guy keeps scooting to the left as we near November. We've been utterly screwed this cycle, and I lay the blame on primarily on Rubio. Had Rubio dropped at the same time as Paul, as he should've, and had we unified around Cruz, we would've had a legitimate shot at making our case to America. But...Rubio's pride got in the way. \n\nI will not forgive him for it. Paul got out when he needed to. But Rubio? Kasich? Those guys stuck around long enough to let Trump get thin margins of victory in winner-take-all states, sealing our fate. They will **never** get my vote."", 'The GOP gained full control of the Congress in 2010. Since then, they made zero attempts to improve healthcare. That is more than eight years with no plan, and multiple attempts to repeal the ACA.\n\nAll the stuff since Trump came into office has been the same. Find a way to dismantle the ACA and take away coverage from millions of Americans.\n\nAnd, most of the stuff you mentioned has not taken effect. Just the fact that you refer to an ""Obama judge"" shows you don\'t understand the law. That case was the industry suing to block the rule from going into effect. The judge must have seen some merit in the case, and who he was appointed by probably has nothing to do with it.\n\nAnd you do realize that all the criticisms you just made of Obama were the status quo under Bush, right? You can say Obama didn\'t go far enough, but he didn\'t create any of those issues. The reason the ACA didn\'t go further was because they tried to get bipartisan support but amended it to placate the GOP. And, for all that debate and compromise, not a single Republican voted for it.\n\nIf Trump\'s pricing transparency measures actually go into effect, I will give him credit for that. But the GOP, broadly, is doing more to take healthcare away from people than they are to expanding or improving it.', 'A large number of voters (a majority even) will only ever vote for one party. Therefore, to win an election (on top the uneven electorate sizes and so on) you need a candidate that can do one or both of the following:\n\n1 - Convince swing voters to vote for them and their party.\n\n2 - Energise their own supporters to actually vote.\n\nSo you are actually only focused on a fairly small percentage of the voting public. And, of course, you are only really concerned about these two groups in the small number of swing states…\n\nSo yes, outspoken may be a good thing, but they would need to be very careful about what they are outspoken on…']"

I ***highly*** doubt that the strike was intentional.  A single small strike against Poland that achieves literally no objective other than giving NATO a casus belli to enter the war is such a stupid idea that not even the Russians dumb as dirt commanders would float the idea.\n\nRussia\'s goals in Ukraine have changed over time as Ukraine has denied them one objective after another.  One goal that has been absolutely consistent for Russia though is to, whatever they do, not get NATO involved.  In fact, keeping NATO from getting involved is the absolute highest priority for the completely obvious reason that Russia\'s military would be destroyed if NATO joined, and their only recourse would be nukes.\n\nRussia almost certainly didn\'t attack Poland intentionally, and as a result, NATO will almost certainly not escalate in a violent manner.  NATO ""escalation"" for this incident will be NATO supplying Ukraine with more weapons of the type that they want.  NATO might use this as an excuse to hand over some weapons that they had previously holding back on, but that\'s pretty much the extent of the retaliation I\'d expect.', ""&gt; We couldn’t just devastate Russia’s military and economy in a conventional war and expect them to not use nukes.\n\nOf course you can. NATO is strong enough to fight the war entirely on defence—destroy Russian assets in Ukraine, without any escalation against Russia proper. \n\nThe Soviet Union lost in Afghanistan, badly... they didn't turn to nukes. Putin may try and portray himself as a crazy man with his finger on the button, but that isn't what he is. Once he opens the nuclear box, Russia as a nation is effectively doomed. Even their supporters will turn on them, China and India will cut them off, because **no one wants that box open.** Their invasion of Ukraine would end in humiliating destruction by an enemy they have spent years acting like they could threaten at will. \n\nRussia is not suicidal. If they're not invaded, they will not choose to destroy everything in order to avoid losing Ukraine. The Russian nation might survive a loss in Ukraine—it would absolutely not survive a nuclear exchange with the west."", ""&gt;Reading the BBC report today that about 75% of Russian adults over 40 years old support the war and the number is only 62% for those under 40, regardless Putin has no incentive to stop the war because he maintains the broad support of his people. Russia has subjected its people to horrible conditions for generations, and so despite sanctions, it doesn't really change much for the ordinary Russian people.\n\nPolling in Russia is difficult, due to the authoritarian state. Which is not to say that people don't support the war, but it's hard to know how many and how fervently. \n\nSuffice to say, Putin doesn't have to worry too much about the people at home and how they feel about him and the war.\n\nThe only way this war stops is if either Putin/Russia choose to withdraw, or are forced to through superior arms. \n\nWithout escalating to something like nuclear attacks on Ukraine, it doesn't seem like Russia has the capability to actually win at this point. And even that is suspect - the US has made it clear they would respond to nuclear weapons in Ukraine with overwhelming conventional force such that Russia deploying nukes would lead to a rapid loss, rather than any gains.\n\nThe fastest way to stop this war is to give Ukraine the weapons they need to retake and defend all of their territory, including Crimea. Holding back is just going to make the war drag on longer because Ukraine certainly won't surrender, they've made that clear, and Russia shows no signs of giving up""]"

You didn't see people energized for Biden, they were energized against Trump.

Rather than the country voting for Joe Biden and his agenda, they mostly voted for or against Trump. Biden was just the reasonable alternative. So, unlike most presidents, Biden doesn\'t have a passionate fan club which is critical, especially in an era of social media. Jen Psaki is the only person out there making the case for him and his party. He doesn\'t have an army of loyal followers spreading his message and defending the attacks. It also means that the Dems can\'t ride his coattails in state and local races.\n\nI actually think he\'s doing a reasonable job so far, but I would argue that with the exact same results we\'ve seen over the past year, a more attention-grabbing communicator with a larger base like Trump, Obama, Clinton, or Reagan would have an approval rating 10-15 points higher and their party would be much more confident about the mid-terms.']"

The goal wouldn't even be impeachment—it would just be to undermine the two separate times Trump was impeached by implying that trying to impeach a president is just something you do when you have the votes. \n\nWhat better way to make their own presidents immune from consequences than to make sure no one takes the concept of impeachment seriously?"", ""The very 1st impeachment of a president was Andrew Johnson and the way they did was via creating a law, that was later found to be unconstitutional, that was designed for Johnson to break and to give them a reason to impeach and possibly remove him from office.\n\nThat was a purely political move to its core and that's what impeachment is, a political move.\n\nA president doesn't need to have actually committed a crime to be impeached, just that Congress thinks that the president shouldn't stay in office.\n\nIf Nixon hadn't resigned, he would have been impeached and convicted by the Senate but I think that Ford would have still pardoned him, so that could have been considered an attack on democracy, as Nixon wouldn't have been found guilty by a court.\n\nPlus the legal process takes a long time, Trump was only just charged for a crime against Stormy Daniels, which took place back in 2016, so just because he hasn't been charged yet, doesn't mean he won't.\n\nMy main point being is that a president being impeached isn't an attack on democracy."", 'I think it\'s been shown nowadays that impeachments don\'t really mean anything if the senate doesn\'t follow through. The impeachment of Trump kind of means nothing more than a footnote that a bunch of democratic reps thought he met the criteria for impeachment.\n\nI\'ll clarify too. I think he should have been impeached, and do not equate a ""both sides"" mentality if Republicans tried to impeach Biden. But I think impeachment largely means nothing to people nowadays if the Senate won\'t move through with it.']"

The speaker vote made them into a laughingstock, especially on the penultimate, when they were talking about how great McCarthy was and how he knew the caucus well and the chaos was actually Democracy at work and McCarthy preemptively celebrated on Instagram... And then it failed. Huge egg on the face moment. \n\nThose deals with the devil might be coming back to haunt McCarthy too. According to reports, his own leadership team is in chaos. It increasingly looks like they might not even have a budget proposal because they can't agree on one. McCarthy is already publicly blaming one of the other Republicans, which is atypical for him. \n\nWe may very well see more speaker votes soon."", ""To be fair, I think this threat is a little overblown, which is why McCarthy agreed to it.  It has a high potential to continue to embarrass McCarthy, but I think a low potential to actually remove him.\n\nAny one member can initiate a motion to vacate, and they wouldn't need any support, and they have rules which would force the house to take it up.  But then it still goes to a vote of the full house, which means they'd still need 5 members to align with all democrats to remove McCarthy, and then start another floor fight for a new speaker with no real consensus.  \n\nShort of a new GOP darling stepping up to steal the speakership from McCarthy with the backing of both the fringe right and all democrats, this is a fairly empty threat.  \n\nBut it means any one member can call out McCarthy on the floor, any day that congress is in session, and very publicly say you're not doing the job and we're going to make everyone vote on it.\n\nThis is exactly what happened to Boehner.  The Tea Party wanted him out, and the democrats firmly said they're not interested in helping because whoever replaced him would be even less desirable.  But Boehner took it as a critical condemnation of his performance and later stepped down anyway.  I don't think McCarthy has even that much dignity, and would never walk away no matter how humiliated he is.""]"
