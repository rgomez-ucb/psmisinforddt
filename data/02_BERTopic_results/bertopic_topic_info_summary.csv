Climate? Even tax cuts for people that are disproportionately likely to be in their circumstances?\n\nNothing.\n\nAll the GOP has to do is nominate their own version of Bill Clinton and moderate on a handful of things and they'd be fine \n\nBut they haven't demonstrated any interest in doing so.\n\nEvery 40 years or so, there is a political shift generationally as the policies promoted by the incumbent political reality become irrelevant and useless to the younger ones.\n\nHoover gave way to FDR, Carter gave way to Reagan, Bush and Trump to Obama/Biden and whoever else.\n\nThere is no reason to believe the GOP can't win today if it moderates a bit nor is there any reason to believe there won't be another right turn in 40 years now."", '100% convinced he wants to run in 2020, realized he couldnt win this time and just doing it for the free press, increasing his name recognition and the free food.\n\nHe is counting on Trump losing so horribly bad in the GE that voters will go towards the middle. Plus, who is going to run again in 2020? Ryan will have a lot of baggage after his years as speaker and Hailey isnt that much of a candidate.\n\nI mean, did somebody knew who John Kasich was before febraury? \n\nThe man has been a competent politician his whole life winning really tough races more than once. in 2011 he was the most unpopular governor of the country and in 2014 he got re-elected with 2/3 of the vote. Do you really believe Kasich has been unable to raise more funds than Christie or Walker that dropped out months ago?\n\nI am convinced that every thing he has done on the last 2 months was to position himself to be the 2020 frontrunner.\n\nI mean, he needs two things. The first one is that Trump wins the nomination. The second one is that he gets destroyed by HRC.\n\nI mean he could be having a little hope to be chosen by the convention but he would have a much better shot at winning the GE at 2020 than now.\n', 'Couple of things to note, here: \n\nOne: The margin it passed by in congress is relatively meaningless. This was a strategic vote, done so in a way to protect as many vulnerable Republicans as possible. Note that there are way more congressmen that voted against the AHCA that are in competitive districts than aren\'t. Many of these districts even voted for Clinton in 2016. They\'re protecting their seats and nothing more. It wouldn\'t have gone up for a vote if the GOP knew they didn\'t have the votes for it in the first place, which is exactly why the initial bill prior to the amendments did not.\n\nTwo: The senate might make major changes... they might not. That is yet to be seen. But more amendments (or a completely different plan entirely) doesn\'t mean that this legislation is dead. \n\nIt\'s May. We\'ve got a lonnnnng ways to go in the 115th session. Remember that the ACA wasn\'t passed until about this time in the second year of the 111th. There is still plenty of time for back and forth on healthcare. \n\nLastly, I don\'t think the the House is going to be as resistant to more moderate changes as people are saying. Legislators now have their names tied to this- Freedom Caucus members don\'t want to have to go back to their constituents in 5 months and explain to them why they refused to pass the ""Obamacare Repeal"" bill. Some might fight it, but going by the current ""nay"" votes, there are way more moderates to be won than there are hardcore conservatives to lose.']"

Trump never did any of that, and while I didn't vote for Romney, I did vote for Bush, and there are Republicans that I would give a fair hearing to right now.  \n  \nBut anyone in the Tea Party/MAGA camp I just can't listen to, because they have absolutely zero interest in actually fulfilling the role they're elected to.  Someone like Hillary, who is certainly controversial, if nothing else, actually is interested in policy and governing and I think that makes her worth considering even when you disagree on the policy, because the alternative is to vote against a continuance of government (assuming of course, the other person/party simply has zero interest in governing)"", ""&gt; reorient voters priorities\n\nSee this right here...this is the real reason why they will fail.\n\nOur elected representatives are supposed to represent us. They're not supposed to set priorities for voters, they're supposed to find out what their voters want them to prioritize and then address those issues.\n\nIt couldn't be more clear by even June of last year that the January 6th stuff was not what voters cared about. The far left cared about massive expansions of government and seeing as they didn't get that they are pissy. They lost moderates when they messed up bipartisanship, the Afghan exit and the economy. The right despises every bit of their virtue signaling social agenda so that wasn't going to win them any votes there.\n\nI have never seen a political party so absolutely rudderless. Everything they have done in the past year and a half has turned to utter shit. Biden now polls worse than Trump. \n\nThey are pivoting to the January 6th stuff because they literally have nothing else. How someone blew all of their political capital one year in and burned all bridges and now can only say 'well at least I'm not Trump' is absolutely unbelievable. Biden is on track to go down as one of the most incompetent presidents ever.\n\nHonestly he should be glad Russia attacked Ukraine, it seems to be the only thing people think he's doing well enough at. Everything else is garbage."", ""But what about checks and balances? Also voters just expecting to vote for someone that will be able to perfectly enact all of their policy proposals is unreasonable and unrealistic politicians aren't any less likely to lie in a parliamentary system and having the executive branch effectively have oversight over the legislative branch creates a massive problem with conflict of interest\n\nThe other thing is lots of times to be quite frank the voters don't even know what they want because in every pole there's consistently a large majority of people that want to simultaneously lower taxes increase spending and balance the budget and it's kind of obvious you can do two out of three but not all three and any political system in which the population is an educated enough to understand that fact we'll have the problems our system is regardless of whether it's parliamentary or presidential\n\nWith all that said I wouldn't be opposed to a state trying it as it could be a useful experiment in democracy but to me the far more important issue is getting rid of first-past-the-post so we could actually have a true multi-party democracy where you don't vote for the lesser of two evils""]"

He had to keep contradicting his experts because he wanted to make sure he was the one telling people what to do. He had to make it all about himself.', 'IMO Trump’s goal is not to be president again, at least that is not the direct goal. He does not want to finish what started. He does not want to help Americans. He wants to undo his loss in 2020, which will result in him being president again.\n\nHe cannot accept that he lost in 2020. His ego does not allow it. He has to stay who he is, otherwise victory will just be victory, not an undoing of his loss.\n\nIt’s quite literally the definition of insanity. Trump wants to do the same thing he did in 2016 and in 2020, but expects a different result. He wants to be himself. He does not want to adapt. He wants to bludgeon the country into submission to him, not adapt to suit the political climate.\n\nTrump is built on the notion that his instincts are always right, that he does not need to learn or adapt or rethink.

The highest single filing is around $500k.\n\nSecondly, most people making that kind of money are getting it in the form of stocks, which means now we are dealing with Capital Gains taxes not Income taxes, which messing with that has negative impacts on retirees, general investment flow, as well as other unforeseen consequences. \n\nThe other problem is that typically DEM policies say they want to target Millionaires, but they typically always end up also hitting the brackets that go from $85k-200k, in order to generate the needed revenue for their big projects/plans. These are typically the tax brackets that always get screwed over every time there's a policy change in the other direction, which is where the bulk of your middle class income resides and that range typically always has the cut off for any kind of benefit. Just look at the stimulus cut offs."", ""Yeah, I'd argue its low wages, not the stimulus. Companies have been complaining about not having enough workers since 2013 or so. The companies doing the complaining are low wage jobs like service jobs, retail and logistics. I guarantee if they raised wages they could get more workers in no problem. The thing is, companies don't wanna do that because it means those at the very top would have a little less in the short term even though its been shown keeping high wages is good for a company in the long term as it keeps turn over low. People who got layed off from their low wage job have had time away from it to realize how unfairly they were being treated and either look for better work or maybe even go back to school. Maybe the goal should not be to create a world where people need to work a dead end, low paying job to survive, but to make one where companies actually have to compete for workers by offering quality wages and benefits."", 'When the Fair Labor Standards Act, which established the first minimum wage in the US, passed in 1938 FDR famously said: \n\n&gt;""In my Inaugural I laid down the simple proposition that nobody is going to starve in this country.

The current situation is the result of conscious decisions and the conscious exercise of political power by the wealthy to protect their interests. If you getting a hamburger in two minutes from your car is important enough to pay someone to do, it\'s important enough to pay them a living wage to do it. Even if they\'re a kid. Even if they\'re living with parents. Even if they have roommates. Your right to save less than a dollar on consumer goods is not greater than the right of employees to food and shelter.']"

You need to specify the crime, the exact evidence you are looking for, and prove that the evidence is currently where you want to raid. Do you genuinely think that somehow the FBI fabricated all of that, that not a single conservative FBI agent noticed, and that Trump appointee Christopher Wray signed off on it all?

Europe will not allow that.  \n\n\nAnd what's quite clear is that Russia is the worst corrupt regime in Europe.  The oligarchs have been stealing everything that isn't nailed down for decades now.  That's why the Russian military is so underprepared and so many of it's weapon systems are mirages.   This is how Putin came to power and was fine with it until it hurt his empire building - now he's having the people who have done these things murdered, not the least of which were the head of their largest tank manufacturer and their aerospace complex.  \n\n\nRussia has committed genocide in Ukraine before.

One goal that has been absolutely consistent for Russia though is to, whatever they do, not get NATO involved.  In fact, keeping NATO from getting involved is the absolute highest priority for the completely obvious reason that Russia\'s military would be destroyed if NATO joined, and their only recourse would be nukes.\n\nRussia almost certainly didn\'t attack Poland intentionally, and as a result, NATO will almost certainly not escalate in a violent manner.

Ukraine would still be creating closer economic ties with the west, even if it was prevented from joining the EU. It would still develop into a competitor to Russia in the sale of oil and gas, and given that they also charge Russia for pipelines through their country it could undercut at least a part of their supply at will. It would still be able to toss out any leader that is too pro-Russia like it did in 2014 and throw out any agreement with Russia they made as well. It would still control the water supply to Crimea as long as it controlled the territory between Crimea and the Dniper river. It would still cut Crimea off from Russia by land leaving only a single bridge that could be destroyed as Crimea's sole connection to Russia.\n\nRussia isn't going to stop until it can control these things or make them irrelevant. I guarantee that Putin will not stop this war until they control at least everything between Russia and Crimea, as well as everything between Crimea and the Dnieper in the south.

Note, filibusters are 24/7 events.\n\nIt forces people to mean it when they filibuster, and will make sure that the entire nation will focus on the subject of the filibuster, which can make one side really uncomfortable based on how the public feels about the subject.\n\nFilibuster a bill to rebuild US infrastructure, you slowly lose support for the filibuster. Filibuster a bill to make abortion illegal, 70% of the country starts yelling at the party trying to pass the law snd a lot of women vote in the next election.\n\nHeck, if the public supports your position, doing an actual filibuster will help your cause.  Handing the Senate majority leader a piece of paper saying ""we are filibustering X"" and having the Senate vote to allow it is silly.']"

Sure, Dems lost the House, and that obviously sucks, but the make-up of this Congress is a great consolation prize.\n\nMcCarthy is screwed either way. If he wants the nuts on board, he'll need to give concessions, and a lot of the stuff they're asking for is... uh, not great for him, to say the least. They want every member to be able to call a Motion to Vacate vote literally whenever (so his job is never safe and the House can vote to get rid of him whenever he makes Gaetz or MTG or Biggs upset), they want committee members to vote for their chairmen (so he can't put his own people at the helm), they want to make it easier for bills to be brought to the floor (so leadership can't block objectively bad, nutty votes), etc.\n\nAnd if he gives in to the crazies, he's alienating the moderates, giving them even more incentive to work with Dems. I really don't wanna be too bullish on this because this kind of dissent usually dies down before January, but even if McCarthy wins on the first ballot, there's a semi-realistic scenario where Jeffries is, for all intents and purposes, Shadow Speaker thanks to the Biden 16 and McCarthy selling his soul to the HFC."", ""Don't forget that the House is holding together by a thread. The speaker vote made them into a laughingstock, especially on the penultimate, when they were talking about how great McCarthy was and how he knew the caucus well and the chaos was actually Democracy at work and McCarthy preemptively celebrated on Instagram... And then it failed. Huge egg on the face moment. \n\nThose deals with the devil might be coming back to haunt McCarthy too. According to reports, his own leadership team is in chaos. It increasingly looks like they might not even have a budget proposal because they can't agree on one. McCarthy is already publicly blaming one of the other Republicans, which is atypical for him. \n\nWe may very well see more speaker votes soon."", ""To be fair, I think this threat is a little overblown, which is why McCarthy agreed to it.  It has a high potential to continue to embarrass McCarthy, but I think a low potential to actually remove him.\n\nAny one member can initiate a motion to vacate, and they wouldn't need any support, and they have rules which would force the house to take it up.  But then it still goes to a vote of the full house, which means they'd still need 5 members to align with all democrats to remove McCarthy, and then start another floor fight for a new speaker with no real consensus.  \n\nShort of a new GOP darling stepping up to steal the speakership from McCarthy with the backing of both the fringe right and all democrats, this is a fairly empty threat.  \n\nBut it means any one member can call out McCarthy on the floor, any day that congress is in session, and very publicly say you're not doing the job and we're going to make everyone vote on it.\n\nThis is exactly what happened to Boehner.  The Tea Party wanted him out, and the democrats firmly said they're not interested in helping because whoever replaced him would be even less desirable.  But Boehner took it as a critical condemnation of his performance and later stepped down anyway.  I don't think McCarthy has even that much dignity, and would never walk away no matter how humiliated he is.""]"

The DNC comes in every four years and dumps money in for a few months and brings in external consultants and staffers who don’t know the state and then after they lose, they bail out and say Florida is a lost cause. And that leaves the state party with no resources and an operation that they don’t know how to run - because every four years when they do have resources, they get pushed aside for someone from D.C.  Republicans like you said, are here year round and as much as I hate it as a Democrat, they know what they’re doing. \n\nWe do need a Stacey Abrams of our own and I don’t see who that can be. Maybe Eskamani? But I don’t see her making moves anywhere near the magnitude needed. \n\nMy big fear is that Democrats have taken the exact wrong message from Georgia. Ie it seems now their move is to just throw money at Georgia because it’s a blue state now. Versus taking the actual lesson on how it became blue and investing in that strategy in other states that can carry big gains, like Florida.', ""I mean given the funding that would have gone into Florida almost certainly made a winning impact in the states Joe Biden needed to win to win the Presidency, House, and Senate in 2022, the National Party made the right decision, as much as I don't like to say it as a Floridian citizen. It just doesn't make sense to reach for Florida when other more competitive states are in play for at a cheaper cost. I think there will be a more serious challenge on the statewide level in 2024 when Florida is one of the better states to challenge for Democrats (Florida and Texas are the most competitive R states)."", 'To be honest, I don’t think Florida is a “solidly” red state. It’s just that the Florida Democrats are seriously incompetent. One of the main reasons Ron DeSantis won by a landslide in 2022 was because of low Democratic turnout. The Florida Dems chose Charlie Crist, a former GOP governor, as their nominee. Obviously he was exciting to nobody. Turnout dropped by 9%, from 62% in 2018 to 53% in 2022. The Florida Democratic Party needs serious change if they want to win the state.']"

They are apathetic/fatalistic about pretty much everything else. But if you fail to protect the neighborhood from crime or mess with merit-based academic systems, they will become politically active. The focus on crime is self explanatory (Asians are seen as easy targets for crime, the community is built around local small businesses that need protection, and people stabbing grandma is NOT cool). The focus on academics is because  it is seen as the only way to advance in society - poor parents would literally go hungry to get their kid extra tutoring. You mess with either one, the community will turn hard on you.\n\n- Subsequent generations of Asian Americans, especially the college-educated, skew liberal. But less strongly because people generally do not believe that either party cares much about Asians.\n\n- Also, most Asians are anti-war, given that many families ended up in America after fleeing war. They did not support the Iraq war and all the war hungry talk regarding China in the last few years is highly unpopular.', ""Yes, because Asians are so stupid that they can't think for themselves and need a white person to think for them. Jesus Christ, the kind of racist logic people employ against Asians to deny the existence of anti-Asian racism is next-level.\n\nEDIT: OP deleted his posts, but the rest of the comment chain shows that they were repeatedly arguing:\n\n- that the data proving racist admission evaluation wasn't real evidence\n\n- that rejected Asian students were just too boring for Harvard.\n\n- that Asians were being lied to by white people and supporting white racism. \n\n- More shitting on Asians while claiming to be Asian themselves.\n\nAnd so on.Basically, trending further and further towards right-wing talking rhetoric. I think that says a lot about some of the rhetoric surrounding the people defending Harvard's policies. \n\nTo be clear, the goal of equity is admirable, but the use of racist policies is not. It's really quite that simple."", "">AA does not inherently disfavor Asians, in fact various Asian groups particularly from underrepresented communities benefit from it. Bias in the admissions process is a problem of racism, not AA\n\nAnd AA frameworks which rely on race as a deciding factor and systematically discriminate against a race are racist. Note that the SC decision specifically stated that race can still be factored in, it just cannot be used as a cudgel against specific races, as it was. \n\n>Good thing I’m not white then, eh? I happen to be Asian myself, one that doesn’t benefit from AA. I was hoping I wouldn’t have to bring that up. \n\nCool story, me too. Why you thought this was relevant, I'm not sure.\n\n> But anyway, there is a bigger picture here that a lot of people aren’t seeing, and it is that Asians are being used by white people to deny progress for other minorities. Whether it’s college admissions, crime, economic assistance, etc. I see right through it all.\n\nGood for you. Not related to whether anti-Asian racism was involved in this case (spoiler: it was).""]"
